                    <p>Born and raised surrounded by nature, we always have been growing our own herbs. Best friends since we were 17 years old, we have travelled the world, exploring exotic places and going on adventures you can only do with a friend you trust. We were introduced to different tea cultures and were deeply inspired by the tea culture in Japan as well as in India. We love the richness and diverse world of tea.
